## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, please report it responsibly. Vulnerabilities may be privately disclosed via GitHub's [Security Advisories](https://github.com/servusdei2018/undo/security) section. We will review all reports promptly.

### What to Include

Please include the following details in your report:

- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- Any relevant logs or outputs.
- Details of the potential impact (e.g., remote code execution, privilege escalation).
- Any potential workarounds (if you have discovered one).

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours.**
- **Investigation and Review**: We will thoroughly investigate the vulnerability, which may take **several days to a few weeks** depending on the complexity of the issue.
- **Updates**: We will provide you with regular updates on the status of the vulnerability, and you will be informed as soon as a fix is available.
- **Public Disclosure**: Once a patch or mitigation has been made available, we will publish a detailed advisory in our GitHub repository under the Security Advisory section. Public disclosure of the vulnerability will follow after a reasonable period to ensure that users have had time to upgrade or apply mitigations.

#### If the Vulnerability is Accepted

We will aim to release a fix or mitigation in the next patch release. If applicable, we will thank you publicly in our release notes and the security advisory.

#### If the Vulnerability is Declined

If we determine the reported issue is not a security vulnerability, we will let you know and provide a brief explanation of our findings. If you disagree with the decision, we encourage further discussion to clarify the issue.
